Garnet porphyroblasts in metasediments from Mageroy crystallized during static metamorphism. They display three optical zones, each having character-istic inclusions and chemistry. The compositional zoning is related to prograde metamorphism (an inner zone, 1, and a graphite-bearing zone) and retrogression (the outer zone, 2). Inclusions of two types are present in zone 1: type 1 are equidimensional remnants of the matrix, preferen-tially included along planes of rapid growth; type 2 are tubular and represent recrystallized quartz grains concen-trated along defects in the garnet lattice. The defects are lineage boundaries between growth segments related to screw dislocations on crystal faces. Crystal growth developed at relatively high degrees of supersaturation, but below the supersaturation required for the develop-ment of dendrites. The inclusions suggest rapid growth of zone 1, caused by heat flow from an adjacent interkine-matic mafic/ultramafic intrusive complex. The graphite-bearing zone crystallized at the metamorphic peak, while the inclusion-free idioblasfic rim probably developed during retrograde metamorphism.
